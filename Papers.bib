The exact expressions of all measures of skewness, except for Songâs, are derived for the family of skew-normal distributions, while Songâs measure of shape is approximated by the use of delta method. The behavior of these measures, their similarities and differences, possible interpretations, and their practical use in testing for multivariate normal are studied by evaluating their power in the case of some specific members of the multivariate skew-normal family of distributions.},

  Abstract                 = {During the solar minimum, when the Sun is at its least active, the solar wind1,2 is observed at high latitudes as a predominantly fast (more than 500?kilometres per second), highly Alfv{\'e}nic rarefied stream of plasma originating from deep within coronal holes. Closer to the ecliptic plane, the solar wind is interspersed with a more variable slow wind3 of less than 500 kilometres per second. The precise origins of the slow wind streams are less certain4; theories and observations suggest that they may originate at the tips of helmet streamers5,6, from interchange reconnection near coronal hole boundaries7,8, or within coronal holes with highly diverging magnetic fields9,10. The heating mechanism required to drive the solar wind is also unresolved, although candidate mechanisms include Alfv{\'e}n-wave turbulence11,12, heating by reconnection in nanoflares13, ion cyclotron wave heating14 and acceleration by thermal gradients1. At a distance of one astronomical unit, the wind is mixed and evolved, and therefore much of the diagnostic structure of these sources and processes has been lost. Here we present observations from the Parker Solar Probe15 at 36 to 54 solar radii that show evidence of slow Alfv{\'e}nic solar wind emerging from a small equatorial coronal hole. The measured magnetic field exhibits patches of large, intermittent reversals that are associated with jets of plasma and enhanced Poynting flux and that are interspersed in a smoother and less turbulent flow with a near-radial magnetic field. Furthermore, plasma-wave measurements suggest the existence of electron and ion velocity-space micro-instabilities10,16 that are associated with plasma heating and thermalization processes. Our measurements suggest that there is an impulsive mechanism associated with solar-wind energization and that micro-instabilities play a part in heating, and we provide evidence that low-latitude coronal holes are a key source of the slow solar wind.},

  Abstract                 = {It is shown that the low frequency plasma wave equation can be obtained much more directly than by the previously used method of solving for the determinant of a matrix involving the three components of the electric field vector. The more direct method uses a two-dimensional current density vector space that is precisely equivalent to the previously used three-dimensional electric field vector space. Unlike the electric field, the current density is restricted by the quasi-neutrality condition to a two-dimensional vector space. Comparison with previously obtained dispersion relations is provided and a method is presented for obtaining exact analytic solutions for the three roots of the cubic dispersion relation. The commonly used kinetic Alfvén dispersion relation is shown to be valid only for near-perpendicular propagation in a low beta plasma. It is shown that at a cross-over point where the perpendicular wave phase velocity equals the ion acoustic velocity, the coupling between Alfvén and fast modes vanishes and the Alfvén mode reverts to its cold form even in situations where the Alfvén velocity is smaller than the electron thermal velocity. A method is prescribed by which measurement of wave electric current density completely eliminates the space-time ambiguity previously believed to be an unavoidable shortcoming of single-spacecraft frequency measurements.},

For the present study, a strong current sheet is defined by a >45° rotation of the solar-wind magnetic-field direction in 128 s. A total of 194,070 strong current sheets at 1 AU are analyzed in the 1998-2010 ACE solar-wind data set. The proton temperature, proton specific entropy, and electron temperature at each current sheet are compared with the same quantities in the plasmas adjacent to the current sheet. Statistically, the plasma at the current sheets is not hotter or of higher entropy than the plasmas just outside the current sheets. This is taken as evidence that there is no significant localized heating of the solar-wind protons or electrons at strong current sheets. Current sheets are, however, found to be more prevalent in hotter solar-wind plasma. This is because more current sheets are counted in the fast solar wind than in the slow solar wind, and the fast solar wind is hotter than the slow solar wind.},

In the fast wind at high latitudes, two resolvable proton components are typi- cally present. Statistical studies of the relative densities and the field- aligned velocity difference, Vo, of the two compo- nents are carried out, considering the dependence on dis- tance from the Sun, the local Alfvâ¢n speed, and the type of solar wind flow. The observed values of vo/vâ¢i, where vâ¢i is the local Alfvâ¢n speed, are less than the upper bound de- termined from the linear theory for electromagnetic proton- proton instabilities.

  Abstract                 = {Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS), a NASA four-spacecraft constellation mission launched on March 12, 2015, will investigate magnetic reconnection in the boundary regions of the Earth's magnetosphere, particularly along its dayside boundary with the solar wind and the neutral sheet in the magnetic tail. The most important goal of MMS is to conduct a definitive experiment to determine what causes magnetic field lines to reconnect in a collisionless plasma. The significance of the MMS results will extend far beyond the Earth's magnetosphere because reconnection is known to occur in interplanetary space and in the solar corona where it is responsible for solar flares and the disconnection events known as coronal mass ejections. Active research is also being conducted on reconnection in the laboratory and specifically in magnetic-confinement fusion devices in which it is a limiting factor in achieving and maintaining electron temperatures high enough to initiate fusion. Finally, reconnection is proposed as the cause of numerous phenomena throughout the universe such as comet-tail disconnection events, magnetar flares, supernova ejections, and dynamics of neutron-star accretion disks. The MMS mission design is focused on answering specific questions about reconnection at the Earth's magnetosphere. The prime focus of the mission is on determining the kinetic processes occurring in the electron diffusion region that are responsible for reconnection and that determine how it is initiated; but the mission will also place that physics into the context of the broad spectrum of physical processes associated with reconnection. Connections to other disciplines such as solar physics, astrophysics, and laboratory plasma physics are expected to be made through theory and modeling as informed by the MMS results.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the propagation, reflection, and turbulent dissipation of Alfvén waves in coronal holes and the solar wind. We start with the Heinemann-Olbert equations, which describe non-compressive magnetohydrodynamic fluctuations in an inhomogeneous medium with a background flow parallel to the background magnetic field. Following the approach of Dmitruk et al., we model the nonlinear terms in these equations using a simple phenomenology for the cascade and dissipation of wave energy and assume that there is much more energy in waves propagating away from the Sun than waves propagating toward the Sun. We then solve the equations analytically for waves with periods of hours and longer to obtain expressions for the wave amplitudes and turbulent heating rate as a function of heliocentric distance. We also develop a second approximate model that includes waves with periods of roughly one minute to one hour, which undergo less reflection than the longer-period waves, and compare our models to observations. Our models generalize the phenomenological model of Dmitruk et al. by accounting for the solar wind velocity, so that the turbulent heating rate can be evaluated from the coronal base out past the Alfvén critical point—that is, throughout the region in which most of the heating and acceleration occurs. The simple analytical expressions that we obtain can be used to incorporate Alfvén-wave reflection and turbulent heating into fluid models of the solar wind.},

The plasma stability depends on all species simultaneously, meaning that a combined analysis is required. Here, we present the first such analysis in the solar wind, using the long-wavelength stability parameters to combine the anisotropies and drifts of all major species (core and beam protons, alphas, and electrons). At the threshold, the firehose parameter was found to be dominated by protons (67%), but also to have significant contributions from electrons (18%) and alphas (15%). Drifts were also found to be important, contributing 57% in the presence of a proton beam. A similar situation was found for the mirror, with contributions of 61%, 28%, and 11% for protons, electrons, and alphas, respectively. The parallel electric field contribution, however, was found to be small at 9%.

  Abstract                 = {Protons in the solar corona and heliosphere exhibit anisotropic velocity distributions, violation of magnetic moment conservation, and a general lack of thermal equilibrium with the other particle species. There is no agreement about the identity of the physical processes that energize non-Maxwellian protons in the solar wind, but a traditional favorite has been the dissipation of ion cyclotron resonant Alfvén waves. This paper presents kinetic models of how ion cyclotron waves heat protons on their journey from the corona to interplanetary space. It also derives a wide range of new solutions for the relevant dispersion relations, marginal stability boundaries, and nonresonant velocity-space diffusion rates. A phenomenological model containing both cyclotron damping and turbulent cascade is constructed to explain the suppression of proton heating at low alpha-proton differential flow speeds. These effects are implemented in a large-scale model of proton thermal evolution from the corona to 1 AU. A Monte Carlo ensemble of realistic wind speeds, densities, magnetic field strengths, and heating rates produces a filled region of parameter space (in a plane described by the parallel plasma beta and the proton temperature anisotropy ratio) similar to what is measured. The high-beta edges of this filled region are governed by plasma instabilities and strong heating rates. The low-beta edges correspond to weaker proton heating and a range of relative contributions from cyclotron resonance. On balance, the models are consistent with other studies that find only a small fraction of the turbulent power spectrum needs to consist of ion cyclotron waves.},

  Abstract                 = {In the parts of the solar corona and solar wind that experience the fewest Coulomb collisions, the component proton, electron, and heavy ion populations are not in thermal equilibrium with one another. Observed differences in temperatures, outflow speeds, and velocity distribution anisotropies are useful constraints on proposed explanations for how the plasma is heated and accelerated. This paper presents new predictions of the rates of collisionless heating for each particle species, in which the energy input is assumed to come from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. We first created an empirical description of the radial evolution of Alfvén, fast-mode, and slow-mode MHD waves. This model provides the total wave power in each mode as a function of distance along an expanding flux tube in the high-speed solar wind. Next, we solved a set of cascade advection-diffusion equations that give the time-steady wavenumber spectra at each distance. An approximate term for nonlinear coupling between the Alfvén and fast-mode fluctuations is included. For reasonable choices of the parameters, our model contains enough energy transfer from the fast mode to the Alfvén mode to excite the high-frequency ion cyclotron resonance. This resonance is efficient at heating protons and other ions in the direction perpendicular to the background magnetic field, and our model predicts heating rates for these species that agree well with both spectroscopic and in situ measurements. Nonetheless, the high-frequency waves comprise only a small part of the total Alfvénic fluctuation spectrum, which remains highly two dimensional as is observed in interplanetary space.},

(1) In the chromosphere and low corona, the successive merging of flux tubes on granular and supergranular scales is described using a two-dimensional magnetostatic model of a network element. Below a critical flux-tube merging height the waves are modeled as thin-tube kink modes, and we assume that all of the kink-mode wave energy is transformed into volume-filling Alfvén waves above the merging height. (2) The frequency power spectrum of horizontal motions is specified only at the photosphere, based on prior analyses of G-band bright point kinematics. Everywhere else in the model the amplitudes of outward and inward propagating waves are computed with no free parameters. We find that the wave amplitudes in the corona agree well with off-limb nonthermal line-width constraints. (3) Nonlinear turbulent damping is applied to the results of the linear model using a phenomenological energy loss term. A single choice for the normalization of the turbulent outer-scale length produces both the right amount of damping at large distances (to agree with in situ measurements) and the right amount of heating in the extended corona (to agree with empirically constrained solar wind acceleration models). In the corona, the modeled heating rate differs by more than an order of magnitude from a rate based on isotropic Kolmogorov turbulence.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a series of models for the plasma properties along open magnetic flux tubes rooted in solar coronal holes, streamers, and active regions. These models represent the first self-consistent solutions that combine (1) chromospheric heating driven by an empirically guided acoustic wave spectrum; (2) coronal heating from Alfvén waves that have been partially reflected, then damped by anisotropic turbulent cascade; and (3) solar wind acceleration from gradients of gas pressure, acoustic wave pressure, and Alfvén wave pressure. The only input parameters are the photospheric lower boundary conditions for the waves and the radial dependence of the background magnetic field along the flux tube. We have not included multifluid or collisionless effects (e.g., preferential ion heating), which are not yet fully understood. For a single choice for the photospheric wave properties, our models produce a realistic range of slow and fast solar wind conditions by varying only the coronal magnetic field. Specifically, a two-dimensional model of coronal holes and streamers at solar minimum reproduces the latitudinal bifurcation of slow and fast streams seen by Ulysses. The radial gradient of the Alfvén speed affects where the waves are reflected and damped, and thus whether energy is deposited below or above the Parker critical point. As predicted by earlier studies, a larger coronal "expansion factor" gives rise to a slower and denser wind, higher temperature at the coronal base, less intense Alfvén waves at 1 AU, and correlative trends for commonly measured ratios of ion charge states and FIP-sensitive abundances that are in general agreement with observations. These models offer supporting evidence for the idea that coronal heating and solar wind acceleration (in open magnetic flux tubes) can occur as a result of wave dissipation and turbulent cascade.},

  Abstract                 = {The heating of the lower solar corona is examined using numerical simulations and theoretical models of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in open magnetic regions. A turbulent energy cascade to small length scales perpendicular to the mean magnetic field can be sustained by driving with low-frequency Alfvén waves reflected from mean density and magnetic field gradients. This mechanism deposits energy efficiently in the lower corona, and we show that the spatial distribution of the heating is determined by the mean density through the Alfvén speed profile. This provides a robust heating mechanism which can explain observed high coronal temperatures and accounts for the significant heating (per unit volume) distribution below 2 solar radii needed in models of the origin of the solar wind. The obtained heating per unit mass, on the other hand, is much more extended, indicating that the heating on a per-particle basis persists throughout all the lower coronal region considered here.},

In the absence of collisional viscosity, the dynamics at small scales is presumably kinetic in nature; the identification of the physical mechanism which replaces energy dissipation and establishes the link between macroscopic and microscopic scales would open a new scenario in the study of turbulent heating in space plasmas. We present a numerical analysis of kinetic effects along the turbulent energy cascade in solar-wind plasmas which provides an effective unified interpretation of a wide set of spacecraft observations and shows that, simultaneously with an increase in the ion perpendicular temperature, strong bursts of electrostatic activity in the form of
ion-acoustic turbulence are produced together with accelerated beams in the ion distribution function.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Intervals of enhanced magnetic fluctuations have been frequently observed in the solar wind. But it remains an open question as to whether these waves are generated at the Sun and then transported outward by the solar wind or generated locally in the interplanetary medium. Magnetic field and plasma measurements from the Wind spacecraft under slow solar wind conditions on 19 March 2005 demonstrate seven events of enhanced magnetic fluctuations at spacecraft-frame frequencies somewhat above the proton cyclotron frequency and propagation approximately parallel or antiparallel to the background magnetic field Bo. The proton velocity distributions during these events are characterized by two components: a more dense, slower core and a less dense, faster beam. Observed plasma parameters are used in a kinetic linear dispersion equation analysis for electromagnetic fluctuations at k x Bo = 0; for two events the most unstable mode is the Alfvén-cyclotron instability driven by a proton component temperature anisotropy T⊥/T|| > 1 (where the subscripts denote directions relative to Bo), and for three events the most unstable mode is the right-hand polarized magnetosonic instability driven primarily by ion component relative flows. Thus, both types of ion anisotropies and both types of instabilities are likely to be local sources of these enhanced fluctuation events in the solar wind.},

This manuscript uses one-dimensional hybrid simulations of the proton cyclotron anisotropy instability in homogeneous electron-proton plasmas to study this correlation which may represent a limited closure relation for fluid theories of anisotropic space plasmas. The emphasis is on driven simulations which increase the temperature anisotropy by periodically reducing the magnetic-field-aligned velocities of the protons. The late-time states from ensembles of both initial value and driven simulations yield very similar expressions for the proton anisotropy/β∥p inverse correlation, and provide a basis for explaining differences between sheath observations from different spacecraft. The driven simulations also yield expressions for the maximum instability growth rate and the fluctuating field energy as functions of β∥p and a parameter characterizing the anisotropy driver.},

We confirm the ability of the ion cyclotron and firehose instabilities to enhance or suppress reconnection, respectively. The simulations demonstrate the emergence of persistent 3D structures, including patchy reconnection sites and the fast growth of a narrow-band drift-kink instability, which suppresses reconnection for thin current sheets with weak guide fields. Potential observational signatures of the 3D evolution of solar wind current sheets are also discussed. We conclude that kinetic instabilities, arising from non-Maxwellian ion populations, are significant to the evolution of 3D current sheets, and two-dimensional studies of heating rates by reconnection may therefore over-estimate the ability of thin, ion-scale current sheets to heat the solar wind by reconnection.},

The nonlinear dispersion relation for the mode coupling in a characteristic magnetospheric scenario is then derived and the parametric decays of the EICW are analyzed. The linear stability of the circularly polarized waves in a solar wind type plasma is then discussed and the dispersion relation of Hollweg et al. (1993) is briefly reviewed. The authors study the nonlinear stability of the alpha particle branch of the dispersion relation, and the nonlinear stability of the proton branch for frequencies of the pump wave close to the proton resonance. Finally, return to the alpha branch to illustrate a number of cases of interest.},

  Abstract                 = {The fluctuating magnetic helicity is considered an important parameter in diagnosing the characteristic modes of solar wind turbulence. Among them is the Alfvén-cyclotron wave, which is probably responsible for the solar wind plasma heating, but has not yet been identified from the magnetic helicity of solar wind turbulence. Here, we present the possible signatures of Alfvén-cyclotron waves in the distribution of magnetic helicity as a function of θVB, which is the angle between the solar wind velocity and local mean magnetic field. We use magnetic field data from the STEREO spacecraft to calculate the θVB distribution of the normalized reduced fluctuating magnetic helicity σm. We find a dominant negative σm for 1 s 150° in the solar wind inward magnetic sector. These features of σm appearing around the Doppler-shifted ion-cyclotron frequencies may be consistent with the existence of Alfvén-cyclotron waves among the outward propagating fluctuations. Moreover, right-handed polarized waves at larger propagation angles, which might be kinetic Alfvén waves or whistler waves, have also been identified on the basis of the σm features in the angular range 40° < θVB < 140°. Our findings suggest that Alfvén-cyclotron waves (together with other wave modes) play a prominent role in turbulence cascading and plasma heating of the solar wind.},

  Abstract                 = {Oblique fire hose instability is investigated using hybrid simulations for proton betas of the order of one and for proton parallel temperatures sufficiently greater than the perpendicular ones. The simulations confirm previous simulation results showing that this instability has self-destructing properties and efficiently reduces the proton temperature anisotropy. A parametric study using one-dimensional standard hybrid simulations shows that stronger changes in the temperature anisotropy and stronger wave emissions appear for larger initial temperature anisotropies. An ideal, slow plasma expansion, modeled by a two-dimensional hybrid expanding box simulation, leads to a generation of proton temperature anisotropy. The anisotropy leads first to destabilization of the dominant parallel fire hose, which interacts mainly with minor supra-Alfvénic protons, whereas the evolution of core protons is determined by expansion. Consequently, the effective anisotropy is only slightly reduced and the system eventually becomes unstable with respect to the oblique fire hose instability. The oblique fire hose strongly scatters the protons and removes the anisotropy disrupting the parallel fire hose. An important portion of the fluctuating wave energy is dissipated to protons, and only long wavelength waves remain in the system. The system with low wave activity then develops again larger temperature anisotropies, and the evolution repeats itself. It is concluded that both parallel and oblique proton fire hose instabilities constrain the proton temperature anisotropy in the expanding solar wind, with the latter one constituting a final frontier for the anisotropy. These results give a possible explanation of some apparent discrepancies between observations and linear predictions. In addition, a simple bounded anisotropy model is developed to include some of the kinetic effects of the fire hose instabilities in fluid models.},

The results for slow and fast solar winds are compared and discussed in the context of previous results. Protons need to be heated in the perpendicular direction with respect to the ambient magnetic field from 0.3 to 1 AU. In the parallel direction, protons need to be cooled at 0.3 AU, with a cooling rate comparable to the corresponding perpendicular heating rate; between 0.3 and 1 AU, the required cooling rate decreases until a transition to heating occurs: by 1 AU the protons require parallel heating, with a heating rate comparable to that required to sustain the perpendicular temperature. The heating/cooling rates (per unit volume) in the fast and slow solar winds are proportional to the ratio between the proton kinetic energy and the expansion time. On average, the protons need to be heated and the necessary heating rates are comparable to the energy cascade rate of the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence estimated from the stationary Kolmogorov-Yaglom law at 1 AU; however, in the expanding solar wind, the stationarity assumption for this law is questionable. The turbulent energy cascade may explain the average proton energetics (although the stationarity assumption needs to be justified) but the parallel cooling is likely related to microinstabilities connected with the structure of the proton velocity distribution function. This is supported by linear analysis based on observed data and by results of numerical simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a series of new analytical expressions describing the physical properties of the kinetic Alfvén wave. The wave becomes strongly compressive when is of the order of the ion inertial length. Thus, in a low-β plasma, the kinetic Alfvén wave can be compressive at values of k⊥ for which the dispersion relation departs only slightly from that of the usual MHD Alfvén wave. The compression is accompanied by a magnetic field fluctuation δB‖ such that the total pressure perturbation δptot ≈ 0. Thus the wave undergoes transit-time damping as well as Landau damping; the two effects are comparable if the ion thermal speed is of the order of the Alfvén speed. We find that the transverse electric field is elliptically polarized but rotating in the electron sense; this surprising behavior of the polarization of the Alfvén branch was discovered numerically by Gary [1986]. We derive a new dispersion relation which explicitly shows how the kinetic Alfvén wave takes on some properties of the large-k⊥ limit of the slow mode. We also derive approximate dispersion relations valid for a multi-ion plasma with differential streaming. We suggest that the kinetic Alfvén wave may be responsible for the flattening of density fluctuation spectra observed at large wavenumbers in the corona and in the solar wind. We also find that our derived properties of the kinetic Alfvén wave are consistent with its presence in the dissipation range of MHD turbulence [Leamon et al., 1998a, b].},

  Abstract                 = {Previous wave-driven solar wind models (Hollweg, 1978) have been extended by including a new hypothesis for the nonlinear wave dissipation. The hypothesis is that the waves dissipate via a turbulent cascade at the rate given by (1) and the waves evolve according to (16). A subhypothesis is that the relevant correlation length scales as the distance between magnetic field lines. This hypothesis allows us to treat the corona and the solar wind on an equal footing; unlike in previous wave-driven models, we do not assume that the coronal heating takes place below the base of the model. The models exhibit the correct qualitative features, viz., a steep temperature rise (the transition region) to a maximum coronal temperature in excess of 106 K, and a substantial solar wind mass flux in excess of 3.5×108 cm−2 s−1 at 1 AU. However, the model fails in detail. Parameters that yield a high-speed flow at 1 AU have base pressures that are too low; parameters that yield correct base pressures have low solar wind flow speeds. However, the model “comes close.” Thus although we have not shown that the initial hypothesis is consistent with available data, we feel that there are sufficient uncertainties both in the model and in the data to preclude outright rejection of the hypothesis altogether.},

  Abstract                 = {We analytically consider how velocity shear in the corona and solar wind can cause an initial Alfvén wave to drive up other propagating signals. The process is similar to the familiar coupling into other modes induced by non-WKB refraction in an inhomogeneous plasma, except here the refraction is a consequence of velocity shear. We limit our discussion to a low-beta plasma, and ignore couplings into signals resembling the slow mode. If the initial Alfvén wave is propagating nearly parallel to the background magnetic field, then the induced signals are mainly a forward-going (i.e., propagating in the same sense as the original Alfvén wave) fast mode, and a driven signal propagating like a forward-going Alfvén wave but polarized like the fast mode; both signals are compressive and subject to damping by the Landau resonance. For an initial Alfvén wave propagating obliquely with respect to the magnetic field, the induced signals are mainly forward- and backward-going fast modes, and a driven signal propagating like a forward-going Alfvén wave but polarized like the fast mode; these signals are all compressive and subject to damping by the Landau resonance. A backward-going Alfvén wave, thought to be important in the development of MHD turbulence, is also produced, but it is very weak. However, we suggest that for oblique propagation of the initial Alfvén wave the induced fast-polarized signal propagating like a forward-going Alfvén wave may interact coherently with the initial Alfvén wave and distort it at a strong-turbulence-like rate.},

  Abstract                 = {We extend the kinetic guiding-center model of collisionless coronal hole protons presented in Isenberg & Vasquez to consider driving by imbalanced spectra of obliquely propagating ion-cyclotron waves. These waves are assumed to be a small by-product of the imbalanced turbulent cascade to high perpendicular wavenumber, and their total intensity is taken to be 1% of the total fluctuation energy. We also extend the kinetic solutions for the proton distribution function in the resulting fast solar wind to heliocentric distances of 20 solar radii, which will be attainable by the Solar Probe Plus spacecraft. We consider three ratios of outward-propagating to inward-propagating resonant intensities: 1, 4, and 9. The self-consistent bulk flow speed reaches fast solar wind values in all cases, and these speeds are basically independent of the intensity ratio. The steady-state proton distribution is highly organized into nested constant-density shells by the resonant wave-particle interaction. The radial evolution of this kinetic distribution as the coronal hole plasma flows outward is understood as a competition between the inward- and outward-directed large-scale forces, causing an effective circulation of particles through the (v∥, v⊥) phase space and a characteristic asymmetric shape to the distribution. These asymmetries are substantial and persist to the outer limit of the model computation, where they should be observable by the Solar Probe Plus instruments.},

The waves propagate nearly parallel to the magnetic field and are below the local proton gyrofrequency in the solar wind frame. Because the twin STEREO spacecraft were far away from any planet, including the Earth, the waves do not have a planetary source. The ICWs often appear when the interplanetary magnetic field is more radial than the nominal Parker spiral. Since the wave frequency in the spacecraft frame is higher than the local proton gyrofrequency, the waves are not locally generated by ion pickup. Observations are consistent with wave generation closer to the Sun and outward transport by the super-Alfvénic solar wind. The waves are intrinsically left-hand polarized in the solar wind frame, but appear to be both left- and right-handed in the spacecraft frame, associated with outward and inward propagation, respectively. The relative amplitudes of the left-handed and right-handed waves support the closer-to-Sun generation scenario.},

  Abstract                 = {Transverse, near-circularly polarized, parallel-propagating electromagnetic waves around the proton cyclotron frequency were found sporadically in the solar wind throughout the inner heliosphere. They could play an important role in heating and accelerating the solar wind. These low-frequency waves (LFWs) are intermittent but often occur in prolonged bursts lasting over 10 minutes, named "LFW storms." Through a comprehensive survey of them from Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory A using dynamic spectral wave analysis, we have identified 241 LFW storms in 2008, present 0.9% of the time. They are left-hand (LH) or right-hand (RH) polarized in the spacecraft frame with similar characteristics, probably due to Doppler shift of the same type of waves or waves of intrinsically different polarities. In rare cases, the opposite polarities are observed closely in time or even simultaneously. Having ruled out interplanetary coronal mass ejections, shocks, energetic particles, comets, planets, and interstellar ions as LFW sources, we discuss the remaining generation scenarios: LH ion cyclotron instability driven by greater perpendicular temperature than parallel temperature or by ring-beam distribution, and RH ion fire hose instability driven by inverse temperature anisotropy or by cool ion beams. The investigation of solar wind conditions is compromised by the bias of the one-dimensional Maxwellian fit used for plasma data calibration. However, the LFW storms are preferentially detected in rarefaction regions following fast winds and when the magnetic field is radial. This preference may be related to the ion cyclotron anisotropy instability in fast wind and the minimum in damping along the radial field.},

  Abstract                 = {The Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons (SWEAP) Investigation on Solar Probe Plus is a four sensor instrument suite that provides complete measurements of the electrons and ionized helium and hydrogen that constitute the bulk of solar wind and coronal plasma. SWEAP consists of the Solar Probe Cup (SPC) and the Solar Probe Analyzers (SPAN). SPC is a Faraday Cup that looks directly at the Sun and measures ion and electron fluxes and flow angles as a function of energy. SPAN consists of an ion and electron electrostatic analyzer (ESA) on the ram side of SPP (SPAN-A) and an electron ESA on the anti-ram side (SPAN-B). The SPAN-A ion ESA has a time of flight section that enables it to sort particles by their mass/charge ratio, permitting differentiation of ion species. SPAN-A and -B are rotated relative to one another so their broad fields of view combine like the seams on a baseball to view the entire sky except for the region obscured by the heat shield and covered by SPC. Observations by SPC and SPAN produce the combined field of view and measurement capabilities required to fulfill the science objectives of SWEAP and Solar Probe Plus. SWEAP measurements, in concert with magnetic and electric fields, energetic particles, and white light contextual imaging will enable discovery and understanding of solar wind acceleration and formation, coronal and solar wind heating, and particle acceleration in the inner heliosphere of the solar system. SPC and SPAN are managed by the SWEAP Electronics Module (SWEM), which distributes power, formats onboard data products, and serves as a single electrical interface to the spacecraft. SWEAP data products include ion and electron velocity distribution functions with high energy and angular resolution. Full resolution data are stored within the SWEM, enabling high resolution observations of structures such as shocks, reconnection events, and other transient structures to be selected for download after the fact. This paper describes the implementation of the SWEAP Investigation, the driving requirements for the suite, expected performance of the instruments, and planned data products, as of mission preliminary design review.},

  Abstract                 = {The prediction of a supersonic solar wind1 was first confirmed by spacecraft near Earth2,3 and later by spacecraft at heliocentric distances as small as 62 solar radii4. These missions showed that plasma accelerates as it emerges from the corona, aided by unidentified processes that transport energy outwards from the Sun before depositing it in the wind. Alfv{\'e}nic fluctuations are a promising candidate for such a process because they are seen in the corona and solar wind and contain considerable energy5-7. Magnetic tension forces the corona to co-rotate with the Sun, but any residual rotation far from the Sun reported until now has been much smaller than the amplitude of waves and deflections from interacting wind streams8. Here we report observations of solar-wind plasma at heliocentric distances of about 35 solar radii9-11, well within the distance at which stream interactions become important. We find that Alfv{\'e}n waves organize into structured velocity spikes with duration of up to minutes, which are associated with propagating S-like bends in the magnetic-field lines. We detect an increasing rotational component to the?flow velocity of the solar wind around the Sun, peaking at 35 to 50 kilometres per second--considerably above the amplitude of the waves. These flows exceed classical velocity predictions of a few kilometres per second, challenging models of circulation in the corona and calling into question our understanding of how stars lose angular momentum and spin down as they age12-14.},

Linear theory and one-dimensional simulations predict that enhanced field fluctuations from the proton resonant firehose instability impose a constraint on proton temperature anisotropies of the form 1 − T⊥p/T∥p = Sp/β∥pαp where β∥p ≡ 8πnpkBT∥p/B○2, and the fitting parameters Sp ∼ 1 and αp ≃ 0.7. Observations from the Wind spacecraft are reported here. These measurements show for the first time with a comprehensive plasma and magnetic field data set that this constraint is statistically satisfied in the solar wind near 1 AU, with best-fit values of Sp = 1.21 ± 0.26 and αp = 0.76 ± 0.14.},

 He on solar wind speed and solar activity between 1994 and 2010. This work updates an earlier study of A
 He from 1994 to 2004 to include the recent extreme solar minimum and broadly confirms our previous result that A
 He in slow wind is strongly correlated with sunspot number, reaching its lowest values in each solar minima. During the last minimum, as sunspot numbers reached their lowest levels in recent history, A
 He continued to decrease, falling to half the levels observed in slow wind during the previous minimum and, for the first time observed, decreasing even in the fastest solar wind. We have also extended our previous analysis by adding measurements of the mean carbon and oxygen charge states observed with the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft since 1998. We find that as solar activity decreased, the mean charge states of oxygen and carbon for solar wind of a given speed also fell, implying that the wind was formed in cooler regions in the corona during the recent solar minimum. The physical processes in the coronal responsible for establishing the mean charge state and speed of the solar wind have evolved with solar activity and time.},

From these comparisons, it is hypothesized that the observed signatures result from a perpendicular cascade of Alfvénic fluctuations and a local, non-turbulent population of ion-cyclotron or whistler waves generated by temperature anisotropy instabilities. By constraining the model's free parameters through comparison to in situ data, it is found that, on average, ∼95% of the power near dissipative scales is contained in a perpendicular Alfvénic cascade and that the parallel fluctuations are propagating nearly unidirectionally. The effects of aliasing on magnetic helicity measurements are considered and shown to be significant near the Nyquist frequency.},

  Abstract                 = {Although the mechanisms responsible for heating the Sun's corona and accelerating the solar wind are still being actively investigated, it is largely accepted that photospheric motions provide the energy source and that the magnetic field must play a key role in the process. Verdini et al. presented a model for heating and accelerating the solar wind based on the turbulent dissipation of Alfvén waves. We first use a time-dependent model of the solar wind to reproduce one of Verdini et al.'s solutions; then, we extend its application to the case where the energy equation includes thermal conduction and radiation losses, and the upper chromosphere is part of the computational domain. Using this model, we explore the parameter space and describe the characteristics of a fast solar wind solution. We discuss how this formulation may be applied to a three-dimensional MHD model of the corona and solar wind.},

These measures are shown to possess desirable properties. The asymptotic distributions of the measures for samples from a multivariate normal population are derived and a test of multivariate normality is proposed. The effect of nonnormality on the size of the one-sample Hotelling's T2 test is studied empirically with the help of these measures, and it is found that Hotelling's T2 test is more sensitive to the measure of skewness than to the measure of kurtosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Kinetic microinstabilities in the solar wind arise when its non-thermal properties become too extreme. This thesis project focused specifically on the four instabilities associated with ion temperature anisotropy: the cyclotron, mirror, and parallel and oblique firehose instabilities. Numerous studies have provided evidence that proton temperature anisotropy in the solar wind is limited by the actions of these instabilities. For this project, a fully revised analysis of data from the \it{Wind} spacecraftâs Faraday cups and calculations from linear Vlasov theory were used to extend these findings in two respects. First, theoretical thresholds were derived for $\alpha$-particle temperature anisotropy instabilities, which were then found to be consistent with a statistical analysis of Wind $\alpha$-particle data. This suggests that $\alpha$-particles, which constitute only about $5\%$ of ions in the solar wind, are nevertheless able to drive temperature anisotropy instabilities. Second, a statistical analysis of Wind proton data found that proton temperature was significantly enhanced in plasma unstable due to proton temperature anisotropy. This implies that extreme proton temperature anisotropies in solar wind at $1$ AU arise from ongoing anisotropic heating (versus cooling from, e.g., CGL double adiabatic expansion). Together, these results provide further insight into the complex evolution of the solar windâs non-fluid properties.},

The three different approaches converge toward the same instability threshold condition which is in good agreement with in situ observations, suggesting that such instability is relevant in the solar wind context. We investigate also the effect of the wave-particle interactions on shaping the proton distribution function and on the evolution of the spectrum of the magnetic fluctuations during the expansion. We find that the resonant interaction can provide the proton distribution function to depart from the bi-Maxwellian form.},

A nonlinear cascade drives fluctuations toward short wavelengths which are transverse to the mean field, thereby heating at rates insensitive to restrictive Alfvén timescales. A phenomenology is presented, providing estimates of achievable heating efficiency that are most favorable.},

  Abstract                 = {NASA's Parker Solar Probe mission1 recently plunged through the inner heliosphere of the Sun to its perihelia, about 24 million kilometres from the Sun. Previous studies farther from the Sun (performed mostly at a distance of 1 astronomical unit) indicate that solar energetic particles are accelerated from a few kiloelectronvolts up to near-relativistic energies via at least two processes: 'impulsive' events, which are usually associated with magnetic reconnection in solar flares and are typically enriched in electrons, helium-3 and heavier ions2, and 'gradual' events3,4, which are typically associated with large coronal-mass-ejection-driven shocks and compressions moving through the corona and inner solar wind?and are?the?dominant?source of protons with energies between?1 and 10 megaelectronvolts. However, some events show aspects of both processes and the electron-proton ratio is not bimodally distributed, as would be expected if there were only two possible processes5. These processes have been very difficult to resolve from prior observations, owing to the various transport effects that affect the energetic particle population en route to more distant spacecraft6. Here we report observations of the near-Sun energetic particle radiation environment over the first two orbits of the probe. We find a variety of energetic particle events accelerated both locally and remotely including by corotating interaction regions, impulsive events driven by acceleration near the Sun, and an event related to a coronal mass ejection. We provide direct observations of the energetic particle radiation environment in the region just above the corona of the Sun and directly explore the physics of particle acceleration and transport.},

  Abstract                 = {In situ studies of the magnetic fields in space by spacecraft (S/C) began 4 decades ago. The experiments were initially difficult to perform and interpret accurately because of contamination by S/C-generated magnetic fields, partial measurements of the vector field, limited mass and power for the instrumentation, low-data-rate sampling, discontinuous or spotty data coverage, and sometimes unknown orientation or location of the S/C. As each of these challenges was overcome, an initial view of the macrostructure of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) emerged, substantiating the Archimedean spiral structure and solar origin of the IMF as proposed theoretically by E. N. Parker. An important mesoscale feature noted early on was the sectoring of the IMF into an ordered sequence of alternating polarities associated with solar sources. Subsequent studies catalogued the microscale magnetohydrodynamic structures: shock waves, and tangential and rotational discontinuities and fluctuations. Correlations with solar photospheric magnetic fields, coronal holes and in situ plasma, and energetic particles elaborated more completely on the structure and dynamics of the IMF. This paper will provide a brief historical summary of the study of the IMF or, as it is now more commonly referred to, the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF).},

  Abstract                 = {Several recent studies indicate that there are very few discontinuities in the solar wind that have both the small changes in field magnitude and the large components of the magnetic field normal to the discontinuity surface that are commonly assumed to be signatures of rotational discontinuities (RDs). Those results call into question the validity of earlier studies based on the minimum variance technique for determining the direction of the normal to the discontinuity; many of those studies concluded that RDs occur more frequently than tangential discontinuities (TDs). The new results raise the question of whether the discontinuities with both small magnitude changes and small normal components are TDs with small magnitude changes or RDs with small normal components. Reexamination of an earlier study of discontinuities observed with the ISEE 3 spacecraft and consideration of the plasma jump conditions across some of the discontinuities observed by Cluster fail to give a clear answer. The pros and cons of the two interpretations are summarized.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the effects of plasma ? (the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure) on the evolution of kinetic plasma turbulence using fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of decaying turbulence. We find that the plasma ? systematically affects spectra, measures of intermittency, decay rates of turbulence fluctuations, and partitioning over different channels of energy exchange. More specifically, an increase in plasma ? leads to greater total heating, with proton heating preferentially more than electrons. Implications for achieving magnetosheath like temperature ratios are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {We present direct numerical simulations of inhomogeneous reduced magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) turbulence between the Sun and the Alfvén critical point. These are the first such simulations that take into account the solar-wind outflow velocity and the radial inhomogeneity of the background solar wind without approximating the nonlinear terms in the governing equations. RMHD turbulence is driven by outward-propagating Alfvén waves (z
 + fluctuations) launched from the Sun, which undergo partial non-WKB reflection to produce sunward-propagating Alfvén waves (z
 – fluctuations). We present 10 simulations with different values of the correlation time and perpendicular correlation length L
 ⊥☉ of outward-propagating Alfvén waves at the coronal base. We find that between 15% and 33% of the z
 + energy launched into the corona dissipates between the coronal base and Alfvén critical point. Between 33% and 40% of this input energy goes into work on the solar-wind outflow, and between 22% and 36% escapes as z
 + fluctuations through the simulation boundary at r = r
 A. The z
 ± power spectra scale like , where k
 ⊥ is the wavenumber in the plane perpendicular to B
 0. In our simulation with the smallest value of (∼2 minutes) and largest value of L
 ⊥☉ (2 × 104 km), we find that α+ decreases approximately linearly with increasing ln (r), reaching a value of 1.3 at r = 11.1 R
 ☉. Our simulations with larger values of exhibit alignment between the contours of constant ϕ+, ϕ–, , and , where ϕ± are the Elsässer potentials and are the outer-scale parallel Elsässer vorticities.},

  Abstract                 = {The solar wind proton temperature at 1 au has been found to be correlated with small-scale intermittent magnetic structures, i.e., regions with enhanced temperature are associated with coherent structures, such as current sheets. Using Parker Solar Probe data from the first encounter, we study this association using measurements of the radial proton temperature, employing the partial variance of increments (PVI) technique to identify intermittent magnetic structures. We observe that the probability density functions of high PVI events have higher median temperatures than those with lower PVI. The regions in space where PVI peaks were also locations that had enhanced temperatures when compared with similar regions, suggesting a heating mechanism in the young solar wind that is associated with intermittency developed by a nonlinear turbulent cascade in the immediate vicinity.},

  abstract  = {Using direct numerical simulations of a hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell model, kinetic processes are inves- tigated in a two-dimensional turbulent plasma. In the turbulent regime, kinetic effects manifest through a deformation of the ion distribution function. These patterns of non-Maxwellian features are concentrated in space nearby regions of strong magnetic activity: the distribution function is modulated by the magnetic topology, and can elongate along or across the local magnetic field. These results open a new path on the study of kinetic processes such as heating, particle acceleration, and temperature anisotropy, commonly observed in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.},

We make use of singular value decomposition (SVD) technique and we determine the wave vector direction, ellipticity and directions of axes of the polarization ellipse, wave refractive index, transfer function of electric antennas, estimators of the planarity of polarization, and electromagnetic planarity. Simulations of Z-mode waves, which simultaneously propagate with different wave vectors, indicate that the SVD methods give reasonable results even if the assumption on the presence of a single plane wave is invalid. Simulations of whistler mode waves show that these methods can be used to recognize cases when the waves simultaneously propagate with wave vectors in two opposite hemispheres. Finally, we show an example of analysis of natural whistler mode and Z-mode emissions measured in the high-altitude auroral region by the MEMO experiment onboard the INTERBALL spacecraft.},

The solar wind is an excellent laboratory for studying many aspects of solar and plasma physics and may soon provide some answers to several fundamental questions.},

  Abstract                 = {Intermittency in fluid turbulence can be emphasized through the analysis of Probability Distribution Functions (PDF) for velocity fluctuations, which display a strong non-gaussian behavior at small scales. Castaing et al. (1990) have introduced the idea that this behavior can be represented, in the framework of a multiplicative cascade model, by a convolution of gaussians whose variances is distributed according to a log-normal distribution. In this letter we have tried to test this conjecture on the MHD solar wind turbulence by performing a fit of the PDF of the bulk speed and magnetic field intensity fluctuations calculated in the solar wind, with the model. This fit allows us to calculate a parameter λ² depending on the scale, which represents the width of the log-normal distribution of the variances of the gaussians. The physical implications of the obtained values of the parameter as well as of its scaling law are finally discussed.},

We investigate the relative importance of dissipation associated with collisionless damping via resonant wave-particle interactions versus dissipation in small-scale current sheets in weakly collisional plasma turbulence. Current sheets form self-consistently from the wave-driven turbulence, and their filling fraction is well correlated to the electron heating rate. However, the weakly collisional nature of the simulation necessarily implies that the current sheets are not significantly dissipated via Ohmic dissipation. Rather, collisionless damping via the Landau resonance with the electrons is sufficient to account for the measured heating as a function of scale in the simulation, without the need for significant Ohmic dissipation. This finding suggests the possibility that the dissipation of the current sheets is governed by resonant wave-particle interactions and that the locations of current sheets correspond spatially to regions of enhanced heating.},

The latter are connected to intermittency and coherent magnetic structures, including classical discontinuities. Here we discuss these observations in the context of two appealing theoretical ideas: First, magnetic structures bounding flux tubes can cause local or temporary topological trapping, thus influencing EP transport. Second, charged particles may be accelerated by interacting with dynamic flux tubes, either through reconnection, trapping in secondary islands, or a betatron mechanism. We present observations that support interpretation in terms of trapping boundaries associated with changes in EP flux and also find a case in which an EP peak lies near a coherent magnetic structure that is not a shock, with changing particle anisotropy consistent with outflow from the structure, suggestive of local particle acceleration.},

  Abstract                 = {Interplanetary discontinuities have been investigated at heliocentric distances between 1 and 8.5 AU by using Pioneer 10 and 11 vector helium magnetometer observations. The principal purpose of the study was to investigate a possible dependence of the rate of occurrence and properties of the discontinuities on radial distance. This objective required a separation of spatial and temporal variations and used the simultaneous nearly continuous data from both spacecraft. Discontinuities were identified by using carefully developed criteria that were shown to be comparable to those used in earlier studies but which are still applicable in the weak magnetic fields that are typical of large radial distances. Special attention was given to the identification of relatively thick discontinuities in the expectation that discontinuities might grow progressively thicker with distance. The statistics associated with the rate of occurrence of discontinuities have been shown to be well approximated by a Poisson distribution. The rate of occurrence of discontinuities undergoes large variations, from day to day and from one solar rotation to another, which are well outside the deviations to be expected on the basis of statistical fluctuations alone. Temporal changes in the rate of occurrence averaged over Bartels solar rotations were well correlated at Pioneer 10 and 11, which were separated by a distance of ≃2 AU. The time variations consisted of a slow modulation of the rate of occurrence such that successive increases and decreases persisted for several months at a time, presumably as a result of changing solar conditions. The correlation over widely separated distances is most simply interpreted by a model in which the discontinuities originate inside 1 AU, probably near the sun, and are convected outward by the solar wind. Further support for this model is provided by the statistical properties of the discontinuities at 1 and 5 AU, which were found to be very similar. Clear evidence of a decrease in the rate of occurrence ρ with distance has been obtained. The simultaneous rates from the two spacecraft reveal that this decrease is well approximated on the average by the function ρ=50e−(R−1)/4 and imply a radial gradient of 25\% per astronomical unit. This gradient may be apparent and does not necessarily imply that discontinuities actually occur less frequently at large radial distances. The decreased rate of occurrence may be associated with an increasing thickness of the discontinuities such that they no longer satisfy the identification criteria. Possible evidence of a dependence of ρ on heliographic latitude was sought, but no statistically significant dependence was found. The results of this study are inconsistent with previous inferences of a very large radial or latitudinal gradient on the basis of Pioneer 8 data (Mariani et al., 1973). The reason for this earlier result was probably the influence of time variations which occurred on a scale of several months, as was found in our study, and masqueraded as spatial variations.},

Lett. 101, 025006 (2008)] have shown that the short-scale termination of solar-wind turbulence is characterized by the occurrence of longitudinal electrostatic fluctuations. Beside the ion-acoustic branch, in agreement with solar-wind observations, a novel branch of acoustic-like waves, with phase velocity close to the ion thermal speed, has been recovered in the simulations. In this Letter, we show that these waves turn out to be Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal-like solutions of the hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell equations, driven by kinetic effects of resonant particle trapping. We also discuss the development of the solar-wind turbulent spectra across the ion inertial length and especially stress the fact that turbulence privileges acoustic paths to develop towards short wavelengths.},

In particular the high resolution of solar wind measurements has allowed us to characterize the intermittency observed on small scales. 
 In this paper we will give a schematic view of the main properties of solar wind MHD turbulence and discuss some recent results obtained from the analysis of velocity and magnetic field data measured during the space experiments Helios and ISEE. In particular, we will show that applying Haar wavelets technique to about one year of data taken every minute during the ISEE space experiment, it is possible to calculate spectra and structure functions of the turbulence; moreover the definition of conditioned structure function allows: 
 (a) for the elimination of intermittency effects in spectra and thus for a clear identification of which kind of phenomenology of nonlinear cascade between Kolmogorov and Kraichnan is taking place in the solar wind turbulence; 
 (b) for the identification of the most intermittent structures which turn out to be either shock waves or one-dimensional current sheets, at variance with ordinary fluid intermittency, where the most intermittent structures are found to be two-dimensional vortices.},

We show that most of the dissipation for a given wave-frequency spectrum occurs in the lower corona, and the overall rms amplitude of the fluctuations evolves in a way consistent with observations. The frequency spectrum for a Kolmogorov-like slope is not found to change dramatically from the photosphere to the solar wind; however, it does preserve signatures of transmission throughout the lower atmospheric layers, namely, oscillations in the spectrum at high frequencies reminiscent of the resonances found in the linear case. These may disappear once more realistic couplings for the nonlinear terms are introduced or if time-dependent variability of the lower atmospheric layer is introduced.},

The background solar wind is assigned and two-dimensional shell models are used to describe nonlinear interactions. We find that the turbulent spectra are influenced by the nature of the reflected waves. Close to the base, these give rise to a flatter and steeper spectrum for the outgoing and reflected waves, respectively. At higher heliocentric distance both spectra evolve toward an asymptotic Kolmogorov spectrum. The turbulent dissipation is found to account for at least half of the heating required to sustain the background imposed solar wind and its shape is found to be determined by the reflection-determined turbulent heating below 1.5 solar radii. Therefore, reflection and reflection-driven turbulence are shown to play a key role in the acceleration of the fast solar wind and origin of the turbulent spectrum found at 0.3 AU in the heliosphere.},

  Abstract                 = {Compressive fluctuations are a minor yet significant component of astrophysical plasma turbulence. In the solar wind, long-wavelength compressive slow-mode fluctuations lead to changes in {$\beta$}{\par}p {\equiv} 8{$\pi$}npkBT{\par}p/B2 and in Rp {\equiv} T{\perp}p/T{\par}p, where T{\perp}p and T{\par}p are the perpendicular and parallel temperatures of the protons, B is the magnetic field strength, and np is the proton density. If the amplitude of the compressive fluctuations is large enough, Rp crosses one or more instability thresholds for anisotropy-driven micro-instabilities. The enhanced field fluctuations from these micro-instabilities scatter the protons so as to reduce the anisotropy of the pressure tensor, driving the average value of Rp away from the marginal stability boundary until the fluctuating value of Rp stops crossing the boundary. We model this ``fluctuating-anisotropy effect'' using linear Vlasov-Maxwell theory to describe the large-scale compressive fluctuations. We show that this effect can explain why, in the nearly collisionless solar wind, the average value of Rp is close to unity.},

Here kinetic plasma simulations and high-resolution spacecraft observations are compared to facilitate the interpretation of signatures of various dissipation mechanisms. Kurtosis of increments indicates that kinetic scale coherent structures are present, with some suggestion of incoherent activity near ion scales. Conditioned proton temperature distributions suggest heating associated with coherent structures. The results reinforce the association of intermittent turbulence, coherent structures, and plasma dissipation.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Collisionless space plasma turbulence can generate reconnecting thin current sheets as suggested by recent results of numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission provides the first serious opportunity to verify whether small ion-electron-scale reconnection, generated by turbulence, resembles the reconnection events frequently observed in the magnetotail or at the magnetopause. Here we investigate field and particle observations obtained by the MMS fleet in the turbulent terrestrial magnetosheath behind quasi-parallel bow shock geometry. We observe multiple small-scale current sheets during the event and present a detailed look of one of the detected structures. The emergence of thin current sheets can lead to electron scale structures. Within these structures, we see signatures of ion demagnetization, electron jets, electron heating, and agyrotropy suggesting that MMS spacecraft observe reconnection at these scales.},

  abstract = {If the electron distribution function is approximately bi-Maxwellian with T?/T? > 1, where the subscript symbols denote directions perpendicular and parallel to the background magnetic field, and if this temperature anisotropy is sufficiently large, the whistler anisotropy instability is excited. This mode is studied using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations in a spatially homogeneous plasma model. Theory predicts a threshold electron anisotropy for this instability which depends inversely on the electron parallel ?. The simulations show that wave-particle scattering by enhanced whistler fluctuations maintain the initially bi-Maxwellian character of the electron distribution, and that this scattering imposes an upper bound on the electron T?/T? commensurate with that predicted by linear theory.},
